Draft Twitter Exit Plan Created by methodicjon

Steps / Stages:

Stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance

1. Denial -
      Me : Twitter won't get bad after E.M. buys it. He will make it better, lots of money on the line
      Reality : Seems I was wrong

2. Anger - Yeah, pretty simple here

3. / 4. Bargaining / Depression - ** I am here still **



5. Acceptance - This is what Acceptance looks like.



Steps:


1. Get a list of all the people that I follow
      Exploring: 
       https://www.twtdata.com/

2. Request offical data back up from Twitter

3. Update my profile with messaging eg. #GoneUntilThingsImprove (still workshopping that) and link to 
     https://influencermarketinghub.com/linktree-alternatives/
     
     I personally plan to use https://lnk.bio/
     
4. Reset Twitter password fresh

5. Pick top 5 people I follow and use something like https://mailbrew.com to stay informed 

6. Make Account Private ***Make sure backups of Followers and following is completed prior*** 
   
   This is critical since it will reduce the value of Twitter and protect your content. Hopefully your data can be exported and then imported into a new system


Stage 4 - Letting Go


7. Delete Twitter App 


8. Decompress for one week / until 1/1/2023 without Twitter

9. Figure out a different Twitter Alternative (huge process cloud) lots of unknowns.
